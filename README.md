# DRL_site_harmonization
This is the official code repository for "Disentanglement learning to deconfound neuroimaging data: application to multi-site data harmonization in psychiatry" (in update).

# Scripts:
FC_ENV_fusion_xcov_at_zfusion.py: fusion of brain functional connectivity and environmental data, with xcov site-disentanglement at fusion bootleneck;

FC_ENV_fusion_xcov_at_zFC.py: fusion of brain functional connectivity and environmental data, with xcov site-disentanglement at FC embeddings;

FC_ENV_fusion_with_combat.py: fusion of brain functional connectivity and environmental data, with multi-site harmonization of FC with ComBat;

# Requirements
